# What are the reactive extensions

The reactive extensions extend the callback metaphor with linq to enable sequences of events and managing concurrency.
Is a library that implements the IObservable<T> and IObserver<T>
It will change the way you design and build software:
+ The way it tackles the observer pattern is a divorce from NET events
+ The way it tackles concurrency
+ The abundance of extension methods
+ The way it integrates with linq

## Why
+ React to state changes.
+ Rx is linq to events.
+ Extensible

## when to use
+ when managing events like: 
  + Ui events
  + Domain events like propertyChanged
  + Infraestructure events like fileWatcher or WMI events
  + Integration events
+ Manage concurrency on the purpose of offloading

# Key types
+ IObserver<T>. 
+ Stream
+ IObservable<T>. 
  + Is a simple interface with just one method "Subscribe".
  + Is meant to be the "functional dual of IEnumerable<T>". this means that where IEnumerable can yield three things (the next value, an exception, the end of the sequence) so too can IObservable throught IObserver: OnNext(T), OnError(Exception), OnCompleted() 
+ ISubject<TSource,TResource>
+ Subject<T>
+ ReplaySubject<T>. like subject but gives you past streams. It's handy to eliminate race conditions but on the other hand creats memory preasure becauses caches all past streams. It also admit a cache policy setting.
+ BehaviorSubject<T>. Like ReplaySubject<T> with minnor differences:
  + Only caches the last publication.
  + Requires an initial value.
  + Does not mantain the cache once it has completed.
+ AsyncSubject<T>
  + It only caches the last value
  + It only flush the value when the secuence has completed

When a secuence is completed no more activity can happend on it, A secuence can be completed by two ways: OnCompleted, OnError

##Multicast delegates
They exhibit the following less desirable features:
+ += -= unnatural
+ Events are dificult to compose
+ Events do not offer the ability to be easily queried
+ Are cause of memory leaks
+ Do not have a standard pattern for signaling completition
+ Provide almost no help for concurrency or multithreaded applications. To raise an event on a separate thread requires you to do al the plumbing

## Lifetime management
+ Custom disposable attributes
  + Disposable
  + BooleanDisposable
  + CancellationDisposable
  + CompositeDisposable
  + ContextDisposable
  + MultipleAsignmentDisposable
  + RefCountDisposable
  + ScheduledDisposable
  + SerialDisposable
  + SingleAssignmentDisposable

## Concepts
+ Anamorphism. T ==> IObservable<T>
+ Catamorphism (reduce). IObservable<T> => T
+ Bind (map). IObservable<T1> ==> IObservable<T2>

## anamorphism akka unfold
+ Factories
  + Observable.Return
  + Observable.Empty
  + Observable.Never
  + Observable.Throw
  + Observable.Create
+ Unfold
  + Observable.Range
  + Observable.Generate
  + Observable.Interval
  + Observable.Timer
+ Paradigm transition
	+ Observable.Start
  + Observable.FromEventPattern
  + Task.ToObservable
  + IEnumerable<T>.ToObservable
  + Observable.FromAsyncPattern

## Reducing a sequence
+ Filter & partition. Reduce the source sequence to a sequence with at most the same number of elements
	+ where
	+ Distinct
	+ DistinctUntilChange
	+ IgnoreElements
	+ Skip
	+ SkipWhile
	+ SkipLast
	+ SkipUntil
	+ Take
	+ TakeWhile
	+ TakeLast
	+ TakeUntil

+ Aggregation Operators. Reduce the source sequence to a sequence with a single element
+ Fold operators. Reduce the source sequence to a sequence with a single element as a scalar value

## Inspection
+ this methods reduce our sequence to a single element sequence.
  + Any 
  + All
  + Contains
  + DefaultIsEmpty
  + ElementAt
  + ElementAtOrDefault
  + SequenceEqual

## Aggregation
+ Count. Wont provide the count until it completes
+ Min
+ Max
+ Sum 
+ Average
+ Functional folds
  + First
  + Last
  + Single
+ own aggregation functions, two ways:
  + Aggregate function
  + Scan
+ Partitioning
  + GroupBy
  + MinBy
  + MaxBy

## Sequence transformation
+ Select
+ SelectMany
+ Cast
+ OfType
+ TimeStamp
+ TimeInterval
+ Materialize
+ Dematerialize

## Tamming the sequence
