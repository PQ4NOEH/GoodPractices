# What are the reactive extensions

The reactive extensions extend the callback metaphor with linq to enable sequences of events and managing concurrency.
Is a library that implements the IObservable<T> and IObserver<T>
It will change the way you design and build software:
+ The way it tackles the observer pattern is a divorce from NET events
+ The way it tackles concurrency
+ The abundance of extension methods
+ The way it integrates with linq

## Why
+ React to state changes.
+ Rx is linq to events.
+ Extensible

## when to use
+ when managing events like: 
  + Ui events
  + Domain events like propertyChanged
  + Infraestructure events like fileWatcher or WMI events
  + Integration events
+ Manage concurrency on the purpose of offloading

# Key types
+ IObserver<T>. 
+ Stream
+ IObservable<T>. 
  + Is a simple interface with just one method "Subscribe".
  + Is meant to be the "functional dual of IEnumerable<T>". this means that where IEnumerable can yield three things (the next value, an exception, the end of the sequence) so too can IObservable throught IObserver: OnNext(T), OnError(Exception), OnCompleted() 
+ ISubject<TSource,TResource>

##Multicast delegates
They exhibit the following less desirable features:
+ += -= unnatural
+ Events are dificult to compose
+ Events do not offer the ability to be easily queried
+ Are cause of memory leaks
+ Do not have a standard pattern for signaling completition
+ Provide almost no help for concurrency or multithreaded applications. To raise an event on a separate thread requires you to do al the plumbing
